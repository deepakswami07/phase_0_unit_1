		<h1>About Me</h1>

        <ul>
		<p>My name is Daniel Deepak. I am student at DBC <a href="http://www.nycgo.com" target="_blank" id="city">New York City</a>.  I live in <a href="http://www.austintexas.org" target="_blank" id="city">Austin</a>. I am a motion graphic artist, editor and teacher.  I am really excited to be returning to NYC to be part of DBC. I lived in NYC for many years before I moved to Austin 8 years ago.  I have really missed the street food and the good public transportation.  If you are wondering what sort of motion graphics I do, you can take a look at my <a href="http://vimeo.com/74221686" target="_blank" id="city">showreel</a>.  I love films--both American and Indian, so I wanted to share some of my favorites with you. If you have any questions you can contact me by <a href="mailto:deepakswami07@gmail.com" target="_top" id="city">email</a>.

		    	<h2 class="movie_headers">Favorite Hollywood Epics</h2>
		    </li>
		           <p>Some of my favorite Hollywood films have been epics. I was always fascinated </br>
		           	by watching epics on 70 mm screens wide high resolution films which are able to </br>
                    capture the spectacle of these films.  Here's my favorite five:

		            	<li>Quo-Vadis</li>
		            	<li>Lawence of Arabia</li>
		            	<li>The Ten Commandments</li>
		            	<li>Omar Mukhtar</li>
		              </ol>

		    	<h3 class="movie_headers">Favorite Bollywood Films</h3>
		    </li>
		            <p>Bollywood is one subsection of Indian films, which are dividied by languages. </br>
                       Every region has its own film industry in its own language.  Bollywood refers </br>
                       Indian films made in Hindi in Mumbai (formerly known as Bombay). Many of these </br>
                       are the ones that are famous for their cheesy over-the-top melodramas.  They are </br>
                       a lot of fun to watch!</br>
                       Here's my favorite five</p>

		    <li>
			    <h4 class="movie_headers">Favorite <em>"Film Noir"</em></h4>
		    </li>
		            <p>I love black and white films, and what stands out about this genre is the character</br>
                       development which is really complex, the lighting and everything grey about it. </br>
                       Here's my favorite five: 
		            </p>
		            <img id="benhur" src="images/double_indemnity.jpg"/>
		            <ol>
		            	<li>Double Indemnity</li>
		            	<li>Gaslight</li>
		            	<li>Out of the Past</li>
		            	<li>China Town</li>
		            	<li>The Third Man</li>
		              </ol>
		              
		    <li>
			    <h5 class="movie_headers">Favorite Westerns</h5>
		    </li>
		            <p>I also love Westerns. When I was growing up in India, Westerns represented everything</br>
                       you needed to know about American culture. We thought everyone was a cowboy. </br>
                       Here's my favorite five:
		            </p>
		            <img id="benhur" src="images/once.jpg"/>
		            <ol>
		            	<li>Once upon a time in the West</li>
		            	<li>High Noon</li>
		            	<li>The Searches</li>
		            	<li>TThe Magnificient Seven</li>
		            	<li>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</li>
		              </ol>
		              
		    <li>
		    	<h6 class="movie_headers">Favorite Horror Films</h6>
		    </li>
		            <p>This genre used to be my favorite but I don't watch them anymore because they give </br>
                       me nightmares. Here's my favorite five:

                       <img id="benhur" src="images/exorcist.jpg"/>
		            	<ol>
		            	<li>Rosemary's Baby</li>

		            	<li>The Evil Dead</li>
		            	<li>The Shinning</li>
