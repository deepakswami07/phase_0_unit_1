              <p>Greyscalegorilla is motion graphics/video plugins online store, where you can also</br>
                find free tutorials for many plugins for 2D and 3D programs.  I really like the site</br>
                because it is very easy to navigate. The page layout is very simple, they have a logo,</br>
                important links on the top.  The video, where you can watch tutorials occupies the center</br> 
                of the page. Below the video there are other links that tell you about the plugin kit.</br>  
                The colors are very easy on your eyes.  If you decide to buy their product, the checkout</br>
                and downloads are on the same page.  Most importantly there are no advertisements.</br>
                You can get the same products they sell on other sites, but the simple design is what</br>
                draws most motion designers to this site.
