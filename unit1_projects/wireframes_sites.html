              <img src="images/greyscale.jpg">
              <p>Greyscalegorilla is motion graphics/video plugins online store, where you can also</br>
                find free tutorials for many plugins for 2D and 3D programs.  I really like the site</br>
                because it is very easy to navigate. The page layout is very simple, they have a logo,</br>
                important links on the top.  The video, where you can watch tutorials occupies the center</br> 
                of the page. Below the video there are other links that tell you about the plugin kit.</br>  
                The colors are very easy on your eyes.  If you decide to buy their product, the checkout</br>
                and downloads are on the same page.  Most importantly there are no advertisements.</br>
                You can get the same products they sell on other sites, but the simple design is what</br>
                draws most motion designers to this site.

              <h6>American Film Institute</h6>
              <img src="images/AFI.jpg">
              <p>American film institute's web site is one of the best film history sites. This site ranks</br>
                as one of the top film sites because it is easy to navigate and find any information on</br>
                any American film. The links are very clearly laid out on the top. Important events are </br>
                listed at the bottom.  The background is a easy on the eyes grey, the color palette is grey</br> 
                to white,which brings out the colorful film posters and pictures.  The only annoying part</br>  
                is the looping slide shows.  Again, the layout is simple and not cluttered.  There are three</b>
                things that most want to find when they visit the site, the catalogs, AFI's Top 100 and</br>
                events,which you can find on the home page without having to search around.</br>
