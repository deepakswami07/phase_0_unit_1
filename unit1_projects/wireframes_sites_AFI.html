                    <p>American film institute's web site is one of the better designed websites that</br> 
                catalogseasy to navigate and find any information on any American film. The links are</br> 
                very clearlylaid out on the top. Important events are listed at the bottom. The</br> 
                background is a easy on the eyes grey, the color palette is grey to white,which brings</br>
                out the colorful film posters and pictures.  The only annoying part is the looping</br> 
                slide shows.  Again, the layout is simple and not cluttered.  There are three things</br>
                that most want to find when a they visit the site, the catalogs, AFI's Top 100 and</br> 
                events,which you can find on the home page without having to search around.
