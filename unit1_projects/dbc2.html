                      <div id="scroll"> <p><span>Leonardo da Vinci</span> was a true genius who graced this world with his presence from April 15, 1452 to May 2, 1519. Like Athens in the age of Pericles, Renaissance Italy is a summit in human history. Today, no name better seems to symbolize that age more than Leonardo da Vinci. Not only was he one of the most influential artists, Leonardo da Vinci was one of the most influential individuals in the Western World during his time. He was originally trained in Florence, as a painter and a sculptor, however is most noted for his scientific discoveries and work. He was an observant, constantly experimenting, inventing, and the art and drawings he created, were a way for him to recreate and record the investigations and discoveries which he made throughout his life. In terms of public works, there were very few which were publicly seen; but, later discoveries found over 2500 pieces of work which Leonardo da Vinci had created, most of which were still in his original notebooks. Leonardo da Vinci spent most of his life in Florence (where he was born in 1452) and Milan. However, the later years of his life were spent in Rome. For these reasons, and because of the time period he lived through, many of his art works depict religious images and undertones; most notable of these, and possibly his most famous piece of work, is the Last Supper.</p>
