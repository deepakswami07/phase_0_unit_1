                      This was good break from coding, reading about design and user experience and drawing out the wireframes.  I liked Wireframing as it helped me to go back and fix a lot of design issuse with my site.  As a motion designer, I understand the importance of pre-production and storyboarding your ideas before going into production.  From my experience, I have found that the more time you spend researching and planning the less problems you will have during the production part of a project.  The instructions were pretty clear, sometimes you had to read over a couple of times to figure the expectations. I have found the blogging to be helpful to my learning because it gives me a chance to process and share my learning experiences. I am not used to writing in this way. Each time I do it I feel more comfortable wih it.
