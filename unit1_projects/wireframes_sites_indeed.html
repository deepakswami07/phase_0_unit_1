                    <p>Indeed.com is job search site that is widely used by both employers
                       and employees. The guy who started this website used to post printed
                       8X11 sheets of jobs that were available,in groceries stores, bus stops
                       and other public places. When people contacted, him and he would connect
                       them to their potential employers. This was a very simple operation,
                       but a very successful one.</p>

                    <p>This idea of simplicity is applied to the design of the web site as well.
                       There are only three colors used, white for background, blue for important
                       info and orange for links that you need to use in order to complete a search.
                       The are two search windows where you type in the type of job and the location,
                       making it very user friendly.</P> 

                   <p>The only issue I have with this website is the "post your resume" section,
                      all the information you need to fill out is on one page, a little pagination
                      would make the process easier, less confusing and make it more user friendly.
                      When you land on their home page, the two windows where you type in the the
                      info for the search is what you see, and it is placed right in the middle of
                      the page. In conclusion, all the three sites from the design point of view
                      were very simple but very effective in reaching to the target audience.</p>
