* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
  Good design is well thought out and is simple. Whether it is a poster or a webpage, it has to easily convey the message, if it is a product, it should intuitively help the users put the product to work.

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
  Yes, I love to design.  As a motion designer, I can vouch how important it is to plan and storyboard 
  your ideas before you actually do it.  I have personally found that, the more time you spend in the planning stages, the lesser the problems you will have, once your ideas/plans goes into production.

* What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them? 
  I was trying to figue out if it was better to illustrate it manually or use a drawing application.  I did go over the fundamental of design chapter in one of my books.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what? 
  I did not really have any trouble with lesson. 

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
  Not really.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
  Pretty confident.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
  Checking out web pages for good design.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?.
  I wish they could have incorporated a video on good design as reference.
