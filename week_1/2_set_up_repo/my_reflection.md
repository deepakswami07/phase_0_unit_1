* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Steps to Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Type www.github.com in the browser window.(Firefox,Safari or IE)  This will take you to the Github site.
2. Log in with your "username"and "password"  
3. Once you are logged in, there is "+" sign to the right of your username.  
4. Click on the "+" sign, this will take you to the new repository window and you will be presented with the form to fill.
5. Type in a name you want to give to the new repository in the "Repository Name" section.
6. Then type in a brief description of the new repository you want to create in the "Description".  This is optional. but it will help you remember later when you have many repositories and you are looking for something, if your description describes the project or content you added to this repository, it will be helpful later.
7. Next click the radio button "public" if you want to share your files with one and all.  But if you want only select group of people to use your files in the repository then click "Private"
8. Next click the initialize button .  (This allows you to clone the repository from GitHub to your local computer.)
9. Choose a license from the drop down box.  Depending on what you want to do with your files, you will choose the license type.  If it is free for all to use, I recommend you choose MIT.
10. Check to see if you have all the required fields filled in correctly.
11. Once you are sure, click the green button called "Create Repository.  
12. Next click the "Settings" button which is present in the "Features Section".  Check the "Issues" button. This allows others to give you feedback on the content you add to the repository.
13. Voila! you have created a new repository on GitHub.  Remember this Repository only exist online, if you want to clone(copy) it to your local computer, follow the next section "How to clone your Repository from GitHub to your computer( remote to local)"

"How to clone you Repository from GitHub to your computer(local)"
1.  In order to clone the online repository to your local computer, you need to have GitHub app installed on your computer.
2.  Open the GitHub app.
3.  On the left you will see the username of your account. 
4.  Select the username.
5.  When you select the username, you will see the repository you just created online listed to the right.  
6.  Select the repository and click the "Clone to Computer" button.
7.  When you click on the "Clone to Computer" button, a window will pop up asking you where you want to store the repository. Once you choose where you want the repository to be saved, click save.  Congratulate yourself! you have just cloned the repository from GitHub(remote) to the your computer(local).
  
*Describe what open source means
All computer programs are created using codes.  These codes are what make applications run.  All the codes that run a program are called the applications's "source codes".  For example, everything you type in a "word" document is being run by some codes that you do not see. When you buy "Word", you get to just use it but you do not have access to the source codes that run "Word". 
In case of open source, when you download an application.  You get to use the application and you also have access to the source codes.  Since you have access to the source codes, you can change the source codes to the way you want the application to run to fit you specific needs.  And also, if there are any bugs or errors, you can fix it and continue using it.

*What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
What I like about open source it creates a sense of community, all contribute for the greater good all.  The only thing that would make me nervous since it is free, that someone might use it to profit from it.

* Assess the importance of using licenses
Licenses are important because it protects the contribution, hard work and ingenuity of the creator.  Since most license have some way that the user needs to acknowledges the owner, when they use it.  Without a license it will be easy for someone to take credit or even profit from the work that was not created by them.

* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
It reinforced the whole concept of Git-GitHub relationship and how to move repository for one to the other.  My "aha moment" was when I was able to skip the GitHub app, and use the console to push a file from my computer to GitHub and pull it from GitHub to my computer.  The problem I had was it took a while to find the settings button to check issue.
Also, when I cloned my repository using GitHub app, my remote repository did not show up.  So I closed it and opened it again it showed up.  It must have reconnected and refreshed, I think.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I found code school's try git.  You could practice using git commands.
