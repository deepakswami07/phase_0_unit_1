* What makes sense to you about HTML? What doesn't? 
I understand how it is basically structured, there is the head and the body. The content one visualizes is in the body.  Content can be presented in paragraphs, tables, images and links.  The one area I need to spend more time to better understand are tables, as table are used all over the web pages.

* What seems good and bad about HTML?
Once you understand how different tags can be nested and know the syntax, it does not seem very intimidating.  However, as you make your web page gets more complex, the code gets longer and can at times it can confuse where you are on the page. You need to be super organized and using comments as reminders will be very helpful.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
Like I said earlier, I still need to solidify my understading of tables.  But I loved styling using CSS, after painstalkingly writing the html structure.  My "aha moment" was when I figured out how to hover and change the color of links in CSS, that was pretty cool.  As a designer I can't wait to delve deeper into CSS.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I used adobe's kuler to mix color and get the hexadecimal code.  Also, adobe has cool color pallette themes.  I also had to read up font-size "em".
