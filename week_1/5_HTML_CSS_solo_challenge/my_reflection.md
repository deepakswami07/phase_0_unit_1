* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
  How to meet all the requirements and yet make the design look good.  How exactly does div work?  Most of the resources that were provided were fairly good, but I had to look for other resources to explain positioning.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
  I did have troulbe with div is the beginning, sometimes it would get push down to the next line.  Reading about floats did help out.  I more or less get it.  I will defintely do some reading and will need to do more practice sites, till I am more comfortable with the concept of positioning.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
  Yes, I did learn to scroll text that was overflowing.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
  I am defintely more confident than when I started.  I need to go back and go over everything and do a couple of exercise on my own before next week, as we will be moving into intermediate html/css.

* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
   Psuedo selectors, 'link, hover and visited' and also scroll.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  It took me some time to figure out the design of the page and when I tried to create it, div's were all over the place.  After a couple of tries I seemed to get a better understanding of how they work.
