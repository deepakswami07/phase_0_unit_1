Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down.

As for me, I got off to a very difficult start as I did not get the first email on monday.  This was the email that gave us instructions to read and complete a number of ruby challenges. I got the email on Friday, but fortunately most of the Ruby challenges were simple.  Monday morning, I did not know what was going on, I went on google+ and the boots were posting all types of git, github, gps and pps questions which were all Greek and Latin to me.  I did not know where to start, I made a list of things to do and spread the work over the next three days {:day_one => review html, :day_two => review css, day_three => learn Git commands & everything Git}.  Also, figuring out the calendar was a task by itself.  But all this confusion was good, as it gave me a peek into what to expect in the next three months.  The light at the end of the tunnel was the intro session with Sam B.  One of the things he said and I quote him "confusion is the last tangible thing before learning".  This did ease me up.  The session was very important as I finally I got to interact with a person from DBC.  And he sorted out all our questions and eased our fears. I really like all my fellow boots in my accountability group.  Talking to and getting to know my fellow boot on google+ was also important. In the next few days, google and google+ became the staging area were confusion turned to learning!  All said and done, this has been a very exciting week. It has been a fun roller coaster ride and I am looking forward to many more loops and turns.
