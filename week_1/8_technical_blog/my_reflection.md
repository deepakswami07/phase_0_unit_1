Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

This was good break from coding, reading about design and user experience and drawing out the wireframes.  I liked Wireframing as it helped me to go back and fix a lot of design issuse with my site.  As a motion designer, I understand the importance of pre-production and storyboarding your ideas before going into production.  From my experience, I have found that the more time you spend researching and planning the less problems you will have during the production part of a project.  The instructions were pretty clear, sometimes you had to read over a couple of times to figure the expectations. I have found the blogging to be helpful to my learning because it gives me a chance to process and share my learning experiences. I am not used to writing in this way. Each time I do it I feel more comfortable wih it.
