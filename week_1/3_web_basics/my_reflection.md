* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
I learned the diference between internet and the worldwide web. Even though people use it or think of these two as the same, there is big difference. The internet is network of computers through which you can share information.  But the web is an application which you use to read and transmit data over the internet.  Also, web is made up webpages, which contains information or data.  You use a web browser to read the information that one creates on the webpages, and this inforamtion is transfered through the internet between computers.

* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
Before you set up an html site, you need to get get a domain name registered.  And once you create your content you need a server to host you site.  In most cases, both these services are offered by same company.  Another important thing to rememeber is not all the web browsers can read your html code, for example older browsers will not be able to read CSS.  

* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
I was releived and very excited to see my html page on GitHub, because I used the terminal and not the GitHub app to push my file.  Initially I found using the terminal a bit intimidating, all those green text and the blinking cursor.  But now I am in awe at, how with a few commands you can tranfer what is in your local repo to the remote github repo.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
Yes my "aha moment" was when I was able to push my html file using the terminal!!

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
Honestly I did not.  Although I spent a lot of time reading the link on DNS, but still can't fully understand it.
