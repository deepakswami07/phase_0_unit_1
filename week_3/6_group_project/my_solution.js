// What was this experience like?
// I was nervous at first because I got the refacotring part of the project and I am new to coding and js.
// But since I was the last one to work on the project, I ggave me some time to go over JavaScript basics.
// Working on the refactoring part with a partner was very valuable.  We were able to go back on forth on
// different ways/methods to refactor.  It would have been more difficult if I had to do the whole thing by
// myself.  Even though I was able to complete the project, I still need to go back and spend more time
// with JavaScript.  
//
// Was your group successful in passing the tests?
// I think we had very committed and efficient group.  Everyone pitched in and also turned in
// their part very promptly. I am very happy to be a part of my group.
//
//
// What did you learn about writing user stories, pseudocoding, writing code, refactoring, etc.?
// As someone new to coding, I never thought of coding as a creative process, but after having completed
// the story to refactoring group project, it has helped me better understand coding.  It is similar to the
// work I do as motion desinger.  Starting of with the description of the idea --->storyboarding the idea--> 
// --->styleboarding the idea, to finally creating using a software and then cleaning it up.  This has been
// very useful experience, I learned how to work remotely to complete the project.
