# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
  Responsive web design is how web pages are desinged so they can be viewed on a computer, tablet devices and cell phones. Yes, since people expect to browse on their cell phones and tablets as they do on their desktop computers.  This forces web designers to design and build a web page that can be viewed on all devices.


* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
As the use of smart phones and mobile devices has significantly increased, the need to design web pages to meet the reqruirements of vast range of of these products has forced web designers to come up with responsive designing for the web.  This new technology has led designers to move from fixed grid layouts designs to a more fluid grid layouts designs.

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
There are many ways visually impaired people use the web, those who are mildly impaired can zoom to make the content larger.  For those who are completely blind there are softwares that simulates a human voice reading the computer or produces hard copy output in braille.  Yes, 53.2 million Americans aged 45 or older have some form of visual impairment, and this demographic uses the internet on a dialy basis.  Yes, when designing web pages we need to take the requirments of this group into consideration.


* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
As a motion desinger I have designed motion graphics for various media.  When I do my initial planning, my choice of type, color and other design elements has to be seen at different resolutions.  This was one of the most difficult task as a designer.  I understand the concept of responsive design, but I need to better understand how different elements of the web interact with each other.  As this understanding will help me with designing from wire framming satge to the final building of web pages.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
The resources provided were more than enough.  I plan to go back read them over ot better understand them when I get a break.
