# Reflection Guidelines


## Your Reflection
When writing your reflection, write it for an audience. Tell a story of what you tried and what you learned. It will make it easier for you to go back and re-teach yourself or know what you were thinking. 

Remember, your reflections aren't just for teachers, they are for your fellow cohort mates as well, so be generous! You could end up helping a fellow student learn something new.

Answer the following questions (in addition to the challenge-specific questions) in your reflection:

* What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?   
 I try to really understand concepts before taking up the challenges.  This strategy works for me when I finally begin to work on the given problem.  However, this takes a lot of time, as it involves not just reading and understanding the concepts but also practicing the concepts. For example, it took me a day to understand the interface of chrome tools, the vocabulary and testing different web pages till I became comfortable with the concepts.
 
* What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
  Most of the question I have on how to structure the web pages.  I have found the W3 site very useful.

* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
  They are not really problems, but I still need to get more comfortable with position and media queries.  But the more I use it or work on it the better I seem to get.

* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
   As I love typography, learning to use @fontface was very exciting.

* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies? 
   I seem to have a fair understanding of the concepts, but I worry if I will be able to remember all of it.  

   * Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
   I really like the solo challenge, as we had to apply both design and technical skills.

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Writing reflections is tedious, but I understand how important it is to my learning.

## Reviewing Others' Reflections
Email your accoutability group a link to your repo and comment on each other's reflections using the directions in [reviewing solutions](../week_3/reviewing_solutions.md). When you are commenting, try to look at and address the following:

- Did you learn something from their reflections?
- Did anything resonate with you?
- Did they run into a problem you could help with?
- Are their any concepts you are confused about as well?
- Were you able to follow their logic?
- Do you agree or disagree with their assessment? Be sure to be kind, specific, and actionable with this feedback.
