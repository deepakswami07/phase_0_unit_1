# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
DOM or document object model treats a web page as document and the elements that make the web page as objects.  DOM organizes this document-object relationship in a tree like fashion, where every element is a node of the main stem of the document.  As obects get nested with objects, the original node that grew out of the main stem(document) branhces out.  First when I read the info provided, it was very confusing. But once I saw the videos and completed the quizzes on Tree House, ti made a lot more sense. The good thing about this model is,it is so well organized.  When you use Chrome web tools,it is easy to fix web issues live.  There is nothing bad except you have to learn and get familiarized with the interface.

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
Yes I looked at my profile site which I had built using wordpress, where I had a 404 error and had js before css in the head.  Also, I did run an audit on dbc1 and dbc2 and deleted some of the css info that was not used by the site.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
After the initial hiccup, it was lot of fun.  It was fun to see internal workings of different web sites, particularly after running pagespeed insights and then going back in chrome tools to check the issues.


* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
My "aha" moment was when I got to really understand the interface.


* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
After I saw some videos on Tree House, I signed up with them.  Their presentation of info was very well structured, especially since I am new to this feild.
