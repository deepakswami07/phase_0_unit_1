# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
  My biggest challenge during this time is to balance my time finishing my prior editng/motion graphic commitments that I had completed for my clients before I started phase0.  I am working day and night to keep my head above water on both fronts.

* How will you combat that? 
  Hopefully in the next week or so I will have completed most of the changes my clients have asked me to make.  Luckily, they are not major changes, but still when you do motion graphics even a fews seconds of animations can sometimes take a long time. Once I complete my pending assignments, I will not take up any new projects or work.

* What techniques will you try?
  I make a list of objectives based on importance that I have to meet everyday day and spread them out into three sections, morning, afternoon and night.  Sometimes there is a spill over to the next day but it has been manageable so far.  But I have not had a break.

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?
Stay healthy.  Eat healthy.  I make it point to workout atleast 4 times a week and get 8 hours of sleep everynight.
