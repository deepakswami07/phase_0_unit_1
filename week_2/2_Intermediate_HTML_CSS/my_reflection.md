# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
I think the new standards introducted in html5 are more semantic than the previous versions.  I am very excited to learn more about SVG.  As it is vector based, it will solve the problem of pixelation for simple design elements like logos and will also reseult in less weight to the page.  The inclusion of changes to video and audio is also what makes it even more exciting.


* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
  The header, sections, article and nav are more descriptive of the element.

* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
  Yes I do, because they are more descriptive of their function or how they can be used.  It is also makes reading code easier.

* Why is reset.css necessary? 
To reset browser styles to null and to reduce cross browser problems.

* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
I have tried my web pages on chrome, firefox, safari and opera.  Yes, they looked very different.  From the ones I designed so far, I liked chrome better than most.  But I can see how this can be a problem for web developers. When you design your webpages you need to make sure that your design fits the requirments of all the popular browsers.

  Tree house is a good source for CSS.
