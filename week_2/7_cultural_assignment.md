Write an email to your cohort (using the cohort mailing list your welcome email was sent to) that answers this question. Use the subject "Cultural Assignment" if you are the first person. 
If you are the second or later, be sure to **REPLY ALL** with your response. Be sure to do this by **Wednesday**. 

Starting **Thursday**, take a look at your cohort-mates responses and choose one to respond to. Pretend your best friend is saying that to you. How would you respond? Make sure to direct your response to that person. Reply all to the original thread with your response. 

**You will be asked to submit your responses on the weekly submission form**

**What scares you the most about being at DBC?**

Hi all,
I come from a teaching/curriculum development and motion design background.  I am moving from doing everything visually to coding.  Even though I know that what I am doing is the right thing, as coding is becoming a required skill even in the field of motion design.  I fear on a daily basis whether I will succeed or even make it past phase_0.  When I run into any issues with my work or do not understand a concept, that fear is further amplified.  It has been a roller coaster ride the last two weeks, one moment I feel very confident, and the moment I can’t understand something I feel like this is the end.  This is a big investment in terms of money and time.  Failure is not an option for me.
However, as a teacher who has dealt with students with a wide range of abilities and has seen them succeed.  I keep telling myself what I have told my students.  Focus on what needs to be done today and work honestly, and things will fall into place.  DBC’s community approach to teaching and their very clear philosophy of creating a safe learning environment gives me the confidence at times when I feel to doubt myself.
In closing, we are all in this together, and we need to help and stand by each other. I feel we can do it.
Best
