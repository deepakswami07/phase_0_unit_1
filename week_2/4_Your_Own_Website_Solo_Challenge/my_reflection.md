Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
Design and user experience go hand in hand.  A design has to be simple and light(weight) in terms of content, as loading time is very crucial. Users are less likely to wait for a page to load, it has be found thar users are likely to abadon your page after a 3 second wait..  But at the same time simple design should also be elegant.  So it is a combination of performance and beauty.  

* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
I love working on designing concepts to solve problems.

* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
After a long time, I got to add my buttons like the way I had designed it without using images.  I wanted to place text boxes in two places, but it just threw everything off.

* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
I want to take a look at the overall structure and come up with the way to place the boxes, and also to insert some text.

* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
I found all the statictics about user behaviour facinating.  And I think it is a very important aspect to take into consideration when you are designing and building a web page.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I did read some chapters in a book on typography and Basics of Design.
